Create arabic calligraphy based on generative deep-learning models

This Repository is my attempt in combining two of my passions:
the arabic language and deep learning

Arabic calligraphy represents text in a beautifull visual manner. Unfortunately, my hand is not steady enough and I miss the training to write it with a Qalam myself, so let's try to utilize the power of generative deep learning models to create artistic calligraphy.
